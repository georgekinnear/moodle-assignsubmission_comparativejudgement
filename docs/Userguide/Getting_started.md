# Setting up a comparative judgement assignment.

In this getting started guide we will add a comparative judgement assignment to a Moodle page, and work through the settings.

## 1. Add an Assignment.

## 2. Settings.
Only settings specific to the comparative judgement plug-in are detailed below. 

### Submission types
* Select **Comparative judgement**. You can decide whether students will upload **File submissions** or submit **Online text** or both.
* You can specify the number of comparisons each judge will complete using **Minimum judgements per user** and **Maximum judgements per user**. For a summative assessment these numbers might be the same, perhaps 10 comparisons per user. For learning activities you might require a minimum of 10 comparisons per user, but no practical upper limit so set it to 999.
* For **Minimum judgements per submission** a value of 10 or more is recommended in the [research literature](https://doi.org/10.1080/0969594X.2019.1602027).
